   # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
   # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

   # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
   # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

   # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
   # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
   # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
   # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
   # example:
   fonts:
      - family: Raleway

           - asset: assets/fonts/Raleway-Black.ttf
